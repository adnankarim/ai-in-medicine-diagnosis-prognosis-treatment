# AI in Medicine: Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment

In this project, we will use artificial intelligence (AI) to:

* Diagnose diseases from x-rays and 3D MRI brain images
* Predict patient survival rates more accurately using tree-based models
* Estimate treatment effects on patients using data from randomized trials
* Automate the task of labeling medical datasets using natural language processing

We will use PyTorch and Python, along with various EDA libraries, to complete these tasks.
