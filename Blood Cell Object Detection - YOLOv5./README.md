At present, detecting blood cells commonly depends on artificial counting by observing microscope slides. This process is time-consuming and requires a lot of manpower. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of blood cell detection, we used YOLOv5. 

## Data

- We use a [public blood cell detection dataset](https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/bccd), which is open source and free to use. You can also use this notebook on your own data.

- All the images are in the `.jpeg` format and labels `YOLO v5 PyTorch format`.



## Model

- Model is based on [this paper](https://zenodo.org/record/7002879#.Y3U79b5BxhE).
